# Literature review

- Overview of Existing Research: Existing research in the field of global electricity production primarily focuses on the transition to renewable energy sources, the impact of policy and economic factors on energy production, and the technological advancements in energy generation. Studies have utilized data from various international agencies, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), to analyze global and regional trends in electricity production. These studies often employ statistical and data analysis methods to understand the dynamics of energy production and consumption.

- Key Findings and Methodologies: A significant finding in recent literature is the steady increase in renewable energy production, especially in wind and solar, alongside a gradual decline in fossil fuel reliance in many countries. Methodologically, these studies often use time-series analysis, comparative analysis between countries, and regression models to assess the impact of various factors on electricity production. Data scraping and processing, similar to the methodology used for the IEA data, are common for gathering and preparing large datasets for analysis.

- Gaps in Current Knowledge: While extensive research exists on global energy trends, gaps remain in understanding the nuances of monthly fluctuations in energy production, the impact of short-term geopolitical and economic events, and the comparison of energy mixes across a broad range of countries. Additionally, the integration of emerging renewable energy sources and their impact on the overall energy landscape is an area requiring further exploration.

# Dataset and Approach


- Overall Approach: The primary approach for addressing the analysis of global electricity production trends is to perform a comprehensive examination of monthly electricity production data across various countries from 2010 to 2022. This approach involves aggregating and analyzing data to understand the changes in energy production, with a focus on the transition towards renewable energy sources and the comparison of energy mixes across different nations.

- Data Collection, Description, and Preprocessing:
The data was collected from the International Energy Agency (IEA) using a data scraper, specifically designed for this purpose and available on GitHub. This scraper efficiently extracts monthly electricity production data in gigawatt-hours (GWh) from the IEA's Monthly Electricity Statistics tool.
Description: The dataset includes detailed information on energy production from a wide range of countries, encompassing various energy products such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear, and fossil fuels. Each record in the dataset contains the country's name, a code representing the month and year, the energy product type, and the amount of electricity generated.
Preprocessing: The preprocessing phase involves cleaning the data for any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing the data formats, and structuring the dataset for analysis. This may include transforming the time codes into a standard date format, categorizing the energy products, and ensuring the data's integrity for accurate analysis.


- Data Science Techniques for Analysis:
Time-Series Analysis: To examine trends over time, time-series analysis will be employed. This technique is ideal for understanding how electricity production has evolved monthly and annually, highlighting trends and patterns.
Comparative Analysis: This involves comparing electricity production across different countries and energy products. It helps in understanding the differences in energy mixes and the adoption rates of various energy sources.
Statistical Modeling: Statistical models, such as regression analysis, may be used to determine the influence of different factors (like economic or policy changes) on electricity production.
Data Visualization: To effectively communicate the findings, various data visualization tools will be used. This includes creating graphs and charts that represent the trends in electricity production, the share of different energy sources, and comparative analyses between countries.
Predictive Analytics: Depending on the scope, predictive models could be developed to forecast future trends in electricity production based on historical data.
This approach, combining comprehensive data collection, meticulous preprocessing, and a blend of analytical techniques, is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the global trends in electricity production, with a particular focus on the evolving role of renewable energy sources.

- The approach of using the IEA's monthly electricity production data from 2010 to 2022 aligns well with the identified gaps in current research. The comprehensive nature of this dataset, covering a wide range of countries and energy products, allows for a detailed analysis of monthly and annual trends in electricity production. The inclusion of diverse energy sources, from traditional fossil fuels to emerging renewables, provides a unique opportunity to examine the evolving energy mix globally. Employing data scraping techniques for data collection ensures a methodologically sound approach, consistent with current research practices in the field. This approach will enable a thorough examination of recent trends in global electricity production, contributing valuable insights to the existing body of knowledge.


# Preliminary Analysis


- Dataset Preprocessing
    The initial steps in dataset preprocessing were undertaken to ensure that the data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis. The following steps were carried out:
    
    Handling Missing Values: We began by checking for any missing values in the dataset. Fortunately, there were no missing values in any of the columns, ensuring that our analysis would not be hindered by data gaps.
    
    Data Type Conversion: The data types of the columns were reviewed and adjusted where necessary. For instance, the 'TIME' column, initially represented as a code, was converted into a more human-readable datetime format. Additionally, numerical columns were verified to be in the appropriate data type (floats).
    
    Duplicate Data: We examined the dataset for duplicate records and found that there were no duplicates to be addressed.
    
    Outliers: An initial assessment of the electricity production values suggested the presence of potential outliers. Further investigation and treatment of these outliers will be part of the detailed analysis phase.
    
    Renaming Columns: Column names were reviewed for clarity, and no significant changes were made as the original column names were self-explanatory.
