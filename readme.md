# Abstract

This project centers around predicting electricity generation (VALUE) measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh). The dataset includes essential features like COUNTRY, YEAR, MONTH, and PRODUCT, providing information on energy generation across various types (e.g., Hydro, Wind, Solar) over time.

The main objective is to construct a reliable prediction model for VALUE based on the contextual attributes of COUNTRY, YEAR, MONTH, and PRODUCT. Key methodologies involve comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust predictive model.

The project's significance lies in offering insights into the influencing factors of electricity generation, thereby aiding in resource planning and optimizing energy management strategies.
