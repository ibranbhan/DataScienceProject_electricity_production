# Introduction 
The landscape of global energy production has been evolving significantly over the past decade, with a marked shift towards renewable sources and an increased focus on sustainable practices. This transition is evident in the comprehensive dataset of 'Monthly Electricity Production in GWh [2010-2022]', sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA) through their Monthly Electricity Statistics tool.

Spanning over a diverse range of energy products like hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear, and fossil fuels, the dataset provides a granular view of electricity generation in gigawatt-hours (GWh). The dataset is enriched with detailed classifications, including types of energy products, monthly and yearly breakdowns, and comparative analyses of year-to-date generation figures.

This project is not just a technical endeavor but a crucial step towards a more informed and sustainable future in global energy management. Through the intelligent application of data science techniques, it aspires to contribute to the broader dialogue on energy sustainability and efficiency.

# Problem statment
The core problem we aim to address in this project is to leverage data science techniques to analyze, interpret, and predict trends in electricity generation using this dataset. We will utilize advanced models such as Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to uncover patterns, dependencies, and predictive factors in electricity production.

# Objective
The project aims to uncover underlying patterns, dependencies, and predictive factors in electricity production by applying sophisticated data science techniques like Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

# Dataset and Approach

- Overall Approach: The primary approach for addressing the analysis of global electricity production trends is to perform a comprehensive examination of monthly electricity production data across various countries from 2010 to 2022. This approach involves aggregating and analyzing data to understand the changes in energy production, with a focus on the transition towards renewable energy sources and the comparison of energy mixes across different nations.

- Data Collection, Description, and Preprocessing:
The data was collected from the International Energy Agency (IEA) using a data scraper, specifically designed for this purpose and available on GitHub. This scraper efficiently extracts monthly electricity production data in gigawatt-hours (GWh) from the IEA's Monthly Electricity Statistics tool.
Description: The dataset includes detailed information on energy production from a wide range of countries, encompassing various energy products such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear, and fossil fuels. Each record in the dataset contains the country's name, a code representing the month and year, the energy product type, and the amount of electricity generated.
Preprocessing: The preprocessing phase involves cleaning the data for any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing the data formats, and structuring the dataset for analysis. This may include transforming the time codes into a standard date format, categorizing the energy products, and ensuring the data's integrity for accurate analysis.


- Data Science Techniques for Analysis:
Time-Series Analysis: To examine trends over time, time-series analysis will be employed. This technique is ideal for understanding how electricity production has evolved monthly and annually, highlighting trends and patterns.
Comparative Analysis: This involves comparing electricity production across different countries and energy products. It helps in understanding the differences in energy mixes and the adoption rates of various energy sources.
Statistical Modeling: Statistical models, such as regression analysis, may be used to determine the influence of different factors (like economic or policy changes) on electricity production.
Data Visualization: To effectively communicate the findings, various data visualization tools will be used. This includes creating graphs and charts that represent the trends in electricity production, the share of different energy sources, and comparative analyses between countries.
Predictive Analytics: Depending on the scope, predictive models could be developed to forecast future trends in electricity production based on historical data.
This approach, combining comprehensive data collection, meticulous preprocessing, and a blend of analytical techniques, is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the global trends in electricity production, with a particular focus on the evolving role of renewable energy sources.

- The approach of using the IEA's monthly electricity production data from 2010 to 2022 aligns well with the identified gaps in current research. The comprehensive nature of this dataset, covering a wide range of countries and energy products, allows for a detailed analysis of monthly and annual trends in electricity production. The inclusion of diverse energy sources, from traditional fossil fuels to emerging renewables, provides a unique opportunity to examine the evolving energy mix globally. Employing data scraping techniques for data collection ensures a methodologically sound approach, consistent with current research practices in the field. This approach will enable a thorough examination of recent trends in global electricity production, contributing valuable insights to the existing body of knowledge.


  # Conculsion

  In this project, we've undertaken a comprehensive analysis of global electricity production trends from 2010 to 2022 using data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Our objectives included identifying production patterns, assessing renewable energy growth, and comparing energy mixes across countries. We employed data scraping to collect detailed data, which was then rigorously preprocessed.
    
    During our preliminary analysis, we presented an overview of the dataset and initial findings, such as temporal trends and energy product diversity. We outlined plans for further in-depth analysis, including country-wise assessments, energy product distribution exploration, and seasonal pattern identification.
    
    Visualizations, such as time series plots and bar charts, will support our analysis. This project goes beyond technical analysis, offering insights for policymakers, resource management, sustainability, and economic considerations.
    
    In summary, this project aims to contribute to informed and sustainable global energy management. It leverages advanced data science techniques to uncover underlying electricity production patterns, with significant implications for decision-makers and the broader energy sustainability discourse.
